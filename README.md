# Lyman-alpha forest analysis with wavelet scattering transform
This code provides a tool for analyzing Lyman-alpha forest data using the wavelet scattering transform (WST) and Fisher information matrix. The aim of the analysis is to forecast constraints on cosmological parameters based on the scattering coefficients obtained from WST. A Fisher Information Matrix approach is implemented to predict how well the WST can constrain cosmological parameters compared to the power spectrum.
